# deltaphistar
𝜟𝜱✴︎ or Delta Phi Star is a variant method of determining lightness contrast, and a sibling of APCA and SACAM. It is a simplified version using easily invertible standardized maths, however it lacks  some useful properties such as polarity sensitivity. In fact, it is intended for applications where a "general" simplifed perceptual contrast is desired, where polarity sensitivity is not needed (or is ambiguous).
